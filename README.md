## 📱 Optimized iOS Setup (The "Native App" Experience)
For the best experience, do not run these through a browser tab. Use the iOS Shortcuts method to make MedSuite feel like a native app with zero address bars.

1. Create the Shortcut
Open the Shortcuts app on your iPhone.

Tap the (+) to create a new shortcut.

Tap Add Action and search for "Open URLs".

Paste the MedSuite Hub URL.

2. Customize the Look (Rename & Icon)
At the top of the shortcut editor, tap the down arrow (next to the name).

Select Rename and type MedSuite.

Tap the Icon (next to the name) to change the color (e.g., Clinical Blue) and the glyph (search for the "Medical/H" or "Stethoscope" symbol).

3. Add to Home Screen & Lock Screen
Home Screen: In the shortcut settings, tap Add to Home Screen. This gives you a clean icon on your grid.

Lock Screen: 1. Long-press your Lock Screen > Customize. 2. Tap the widget area > Scroll to Shortcuts. 3. Select your MedSuite shortcut. This gives you one-tap clinical access even when the phone is locked.

4. Integration on App Pages
To navigate between tools quickly:

Use the MedSuite Hub as your "Home Base."

From any calculator (NIHSS or CHADS), simply swipe right from the left edge of your screen to "Go Back" to the Hub.

The Hub acts as the "App Switcher" for your entire clinical suite.

## ⚖️ Disclaimer
This tool is intended for healthcare professionals for educational and supportive purposes. Clinical decisions should be made based on complete patient evaluation and institutional protocols.
